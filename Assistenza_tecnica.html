        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In the summers before starting university, I worked as an assistant for my father, an industrial machinery technician. My father has always imparted his passion for his job to me since I was a child, and I really love his work. This experience was my first real contact with engineering and I was probably too young to have a rational understanding of it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            His field primarily involves woodworking machines and air compressors, both rotary-screw and piston types. During my time with him, I had the opportunity to participate in solving very tricky repairs. These were often extreme cases where even the technicians and engineers of the machine manufacturers couldn't find a solution.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This repair work really improved my problem-solving skills. It also made me better at communicating, as I learned to gather as many hints as possible from the workers who encountered the failure. Of course, I also developed a strong practical sense and manual skills.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            I'm very proud of this experience because, in a way, it confirmed my choice to go into engineering, especially mechanical engineering.
        </p>
