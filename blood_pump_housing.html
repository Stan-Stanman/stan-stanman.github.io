    <h1>Design of a plastic blood pump housing under cyclic load</h1>
    <p>As part of my exam “Case studies - Applied FEM”, I have planned to work on the case study of a blood pump housing. I will work on a simplified version of a real 3D model by TRIBECRAFT. This project will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting of FE models in Ansys for 1 working cycle with particular concern to material properties and contacts.</li>
        <li>Identification of the stress amplitude and mean stress to assess fatigue strength.</li>
    </ul>
