            S.Anna is a textual adventure game programmed in C that I developed from scratch with three peers as part of our 'Elements of Computer Science' exam, during the first year of our Bachelor's (04/2022 - 06/2022) at Napoli.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We, and especially me, are huge fans of point-and-click adventures, like the classic LucasArts games. Of course, since this was our first experience coding something from scratch, we decided to create an adventure game, but a purely textual one. The choice of C as the programming language was a requirement for the exam.

            Personally, I contributed to the project by designing the exploration system. This system allows the player to move around a map, which is displayed as ASCII art, and to observe and pick up objects. To win the game, players must solve a puzzle to open the door to victory. Careful observation of the map and objects is crucial to finding the solution.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This experience was incredibly educational. It was my first real project developped with an engineering approach, and it was the moment I realized that a career in the engineering world was definitely the right path for me.
