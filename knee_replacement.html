    <h1>Biomechanical Assessment of Total Knee Replacement (TKR) Tibial Insert via FEA</h1>
    <p>As part of my exam “Case studies - Applied FEM”, I'm working on the case study of a knee prosthesis. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selecting a representative loading and kinematic profile based on the testing method described in the ISO 12423-3 standard and the already existing literature on this topic.</li>
        <li>Setup of FE models in Ansys following an engineering approach (from linear to nonlinear models).</li>
        <li>Proposing a design improvement based mainly on the stress field and the contact pressure of the UHMWPE insert.</li>
    </ul>
